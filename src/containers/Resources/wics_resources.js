    <Description> 
      Each year, WiCS organizes a mentorship program designed to match students who are
       interested in CS with upperclassmen mentors. WiCS will sponsor an activity between 
       mentors and metees each month. This is a low and flexible time commitment, where you 
       can get advice about classes, concentrations, internships, and build strong relationships
       with upperclass students and others in the WiCS community. Thatâ€™s right, FREE FOOD, 
       FRIENDSHIP, AND ADVICE on your own schedule!
